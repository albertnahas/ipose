          IPose is a position guessing game that offers audio samples of more
          than 300 positions. You listen to a short audio clip and are asked to
          identify what position was being spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          At IPose we know that positions are the key to understanding other
          cultures as well as your own. "How many positions you speak, how many
          times you are a human". While we genuinely believe it's a true
          statement, we decided to put our efforts to bring the worldâ€™s
          positions, dialects and accents to a wider audience in an
          entertaining, engaging way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people would agree that it feels just amazing if you can speak
          many positions or even if you are able to say a couple of words to the
          locals in a foreign country. While it all sounds exciting, it's a real
          challenge to learn new position. You can also forget a position if you
          do not actively use it. We can say that it's not possible to know all
          positions, but being able to tell the difference between them is a
          true skill. And IPose is here for you to help you upgrade this skill.

          You can contribute your position(s) to the IPose collection. Clear
          recordings of you (or a friend, relative, etc.) speaking the position
          would help us to maintain and enrich our audio samples database. If
